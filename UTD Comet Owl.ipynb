According to the International Center > International Students and Scholars Office > Employment and Internships > F-1 Employment > Post-Completion OPT (UTD. LINK/PASSPORT), the ISSO sets the deadline for OPT applications for graduate students. This deadline is significant, as failure to meet it may result in termination of the F-1 status (UTD.

      "        Answer in academic style with citations: \n",
      "\n",
      "The graduation date for Spring 2025 at the University of Texas at Dallas (UTD) is not explicitly stated in the provided academic calendar sources. However, based on the information provided, we can infer the following:\n",
      "\n",
      "According to the Academic Calendar for Spring 2025 (UTD, n.d.), the School Commencement Ceremonies will take place the week of May 19-22, with the final schedule of ceremonies released by the end of February (UTD, n.d.). This suggests that the graduation date for Spring 2025 is likely to be May 2025, but the exact date is not specified.\n",
      "\n",
      "Additionally, the Commencement RSVP Update Deadline is set for April 1, 2025, and the Final Graduation Application Deadline is also on March 1, 2025 (UTD, n.d.). These deadlines imply that the graduation application process is ongoing, but the actual graduation date is not yet confirmed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Furthermore, the Academic Calendar for Fall 2024 (UTD, 2024) indicates that the Fall semester runs from August 20, 2024, to January 11, 2025, and includes Fall & Winter Terms (UTD, 2024). This suggests that the Spring 2025 graduation date may be sometime after January 11, 2025.\n",
      "\n",
      "In conclusion, while the exact graduation date for Spring 2025 at UTD is not specified, it is likely to be sometime in May 2025, based on the information provided.\n",
